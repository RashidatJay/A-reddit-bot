# A-reddit-bot
This simple reddit bot will monitor a particular subreddit for new posts, and when someone posts “I love Python”, it will reply “Me too!”. It will also monitor all comments to recent posts, and if it finds one that says “I hate Python”, it will post a link to /r/learnpython and ask the commenter to ask a question there.
